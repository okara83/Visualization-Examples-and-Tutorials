# Development Notes

## For Contributors

Please read the following notes if you wish to contribute to this repository.

1. Contributions to this reposistory are welcome. 

2. While there are no specific guidelines, please take into account the 
following considerations:
* All contributions must be under terms of the Creative Commons 
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license. 
* Include authorship information directly in any contributed notebooks.
* If you wish to raise an issue with regard to any of the materials in the 
repository, please use the github 'issues' mechanism. That will provide a 
means to track, make revisions, and close issues in a clear and transparent 
manner.

3. Keep in mind that the target audience for these notebooks are people 
learning basic concepts of chemical engineering for the first time, such as 
students early in the first 2-3 years of undergraduate study, professionals 
in other disciplines wishing to extend their skills, or others seeking a 
self-study guide to chemical engineering. **This is not a course in Python 
coding.** So keep the coding as straightforward as possible.

4. For serious development, you will likely want to install a Python/Jupyter 
development environment such as the [Anaconda](https://anaconda.com) distribution. 

5. However, it is also entirely possible to develop notebooks using the Google
 Colaboratory. First, using git, clone a repository into a Google Drive 
 directory. From Google Drive, you can open and close notebooks directly in 
 Colaboratory. Using git (or a github desktop application), you can issue add
 branches, commit changes, and issue pull requests as needed.

## Technical Notes

1. The README.md file is created by executing

    python tools
   
   while in the main project directory. Header text is given inside in the
   tools directory. The notebook naming convention provides the chapter and
   section organization.
